Rosemary Shortbread
===================

- 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter
- 2/3 cup white sugar
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt

In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and 2/3 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the flour salt and rosemary until well blended. The dough will be somewhat soft.

Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into rectangles 1 1/2x2 inches in size. Place cookies 1 inch apart on the lined cookie sheets. 

Bake for 8 minutes, or until golden at the edges. Cool on wire racks, and store in an airtight container at room temperature.
