Vegan Lemon Curd
================
Don't cut corners soaking the cashews, or the texture will suffer. It might be worth experimenting with more lemon juice and less water.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup cashews, soaked for 3-8 hours, drained, and rinsed
- 1 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup lemon juice
- Zest of 5 lemons (about 2 tbsp lemon zest)
- 1/2 cup unsalted vegan butter
- Pinch turmeric

### Steps
In a blender, combine the water and cashews until very smooth.

Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly.

When thick, add the sugar, lemon juice, and zest. and cook for a few minutes until creamy.

Remove from heat.

Whisk in butter and turmeric

Pour into a jar and refrigerate. It will thicken in the fridge.
