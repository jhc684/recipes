Apple and Cheese Tea Sandwiches
===============================
Rustic Alpine is a vegan cheese from Miyoko's Creamery. Substitute Dubliner to de-veagn-ize

### Ingredients
- Fresh sourdough bread
- Granny smith apple, thinly sliced
- Plain rustic alpine cheese

### Steps
Toast the bread and cut it into the desired shape, removing crusts.

Spread a thin layer cheese on each slice of bread - it has a strong flavor, so be moderate.

Layer apple slices, and close the sandwich
