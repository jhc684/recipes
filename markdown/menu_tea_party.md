# Menu: Tea Party
The particulars of what one serves at a tea party can vary, but there are basics which must be prepresented. Tea sandwiches and scones are indispensible, along with jam, clotted cream, and lemon curd. Crumpets are, in my opinion, vital, but I may be in the minority here as many otherwise excellent services do not include them. As to the tea itself, I personally believe that varieties of black tea are the most suitable, and will accept fruity teas despite my usual aversion to them. But fruitiness is not necessary for an interesting tea spread - the purist may restrain themselves to traditions such as earl gray and black current, and scented varieties such as rose, or tea with sage or mint.
