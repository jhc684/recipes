Cream Scones
============

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/2 cup milk, half-and-half, or heavy cream
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and place the rack in the middle of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, whisk or sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender, two knives, or with your fingertips. (The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.)

In a small measuring cup whisk together the milk or cream, beaten egg and vanilla. Add this mixture to the flour mixture. Stir just until combined. Do not over mix.

Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough gently four or five times and then pat into a 7 inch (18 cm) round.

Using a lightly floured 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut the dough into rounds. Place the rounds on the prepared cookie sheet, spacing a few inches apart.

Brush the tops of the scones with a little cream. (This helps to brown the tops of the scones during baking.)

Bake for about 15 - 18 minutes or until nicely browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out clean. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve with Devon cream or softly whipped cream and your favorite jam. These scones are best the day they are made but can be covered and stored for a few days. They also freeze very well.
