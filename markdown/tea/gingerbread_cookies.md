Gingerbread Cookies
===================
These are excellent cookies, at just the right sweetness level, which is to say, not particularly sweet. I recommend icing them.

- 2 cups flour
- 2 tsps ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/3 unsulfured molasses
- 1 large egg

Mix flour, spices, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

Cream butter and sugar, then beat in molasses and egg.

Add dry ingredients to wet using a rubber spatula, mixing until just combined.

Wrap dough in floured plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least one hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Divide the dough and roll out to 1/3 inch thick.

Freeze the dough for about 20 minutes, until firm.

Cut shapes and transfer to baking sheet.

Bake until firm and edges just begin to darken, 10-18 minutes.
