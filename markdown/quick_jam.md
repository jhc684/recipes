Quick Jam
=========
Not proper preserves I guess.

### Ingredients
- 12 oz fruit, fresh or frozen
- 1/4 sugar
- 1 tbsp arrowroot
- 2 tbsp water

### Steps
Combine the fruit and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat.

Bring to a boil and simmer for 10-20 minutes. The fruit should break down and the texture will be a little thinner than jam.

Pour the jam into freshly cleaned jars, leaving 1/2 inch of room at the top.

Refridgerate until use, keeps for 2-3 weeks.
