In a shallow bowl or plate, mix together the ingredients for the topping, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, mix togather the oil, sugar, honey, and almond milk.

Once that is smooth, blend in the vanilla.

Add the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, and fold in with a rubber spatula and/or your hands until you have a pliable dough.

Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls, and press into the sugar, flatting the balls.
