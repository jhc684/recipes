This is an imperfect recipe. It's tasty, but it lacks true rise and lightness.

## Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus softened butter for greasing pans
 - 1 cup flour
 - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 - 3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
 - 1 cup milk, at room temperature

## Steps

 - Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
 - Generously grease muffin tin with softened butter. Place the pan in the oven for 5 minutes to preheat.
 - Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, salt, eggs, milk, and melted butter until smooth. The batter will be thin.
 - Divide the batter into the muffin pan and bake for 30 minutes.
 - Serve hot, with honey or lemon curd.
