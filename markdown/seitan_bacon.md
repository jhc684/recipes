Seitan Bacon
============


### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cup wheat gluten
- 3/4 cup cold water
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 3 tbsp liquid smoke
- 2 tbsp BBQ sauce
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp salt
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed

### Steps
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

Whisk together the wet ingredients in a measuring cup or small bowl, and mix into the dry ingredients, until a dough forms.

Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, until very firm.

Press the dough into a slab, wrap in foil, and bake for 1 hour.

Store it in the fridge, and slice and fry whenever you so desire.
