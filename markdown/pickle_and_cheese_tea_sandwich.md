Pickle and Cheese Tea Sandwich
==============================
This sounds gross but it's actually weirdly good

### Ingredients
- Whatever kind of pickle you prefer
- Miyoko's rustic alpine cheese
- Seeded or plain sourdough bread

### Steps
Lightly toast the bread and cut into desired shapes, removing crusts.

Spread the cheese on bread, and lay out the pickles.

Trim the pickles to fit the bread, and close the sandwich.
