Cashew Whipped Cream
====================
This is great on fruit, but has a present nutty flavor that has to be accounted for.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1/2 cup refined coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 cup cashews
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tsp lecithin
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Steps
Blend all the ingedients until smooth.

Refridgerate for a few hours, until the cream is thick and can be spooned out
