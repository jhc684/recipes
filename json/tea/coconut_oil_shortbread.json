    "notes": "With unrefined coconut oil, this will have a strong coconut flavor. If that's not that you're looking for, use refined coconut oil and consider adding a teaspoon more of the extract of your choice (like almond).",
    "ingredients": [
        "1/2 cup coconut oil, room temperature (solid)",
        "1/4 cup sugar",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract",
        "1 cup flour"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Cream oil, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and combined.",
        "Add flour and combine with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Do not overmix. The dough should be soft and workable, but not wet.",
        "On a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper, shape the dough into a log and roll up in the paper. Close off the ends and refridgerate for at least half an hour, until the dough is firm.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "Cut the log into 1/3 inch discs, arrange on a baking sheet, and bake for 15-18 minutes.",
