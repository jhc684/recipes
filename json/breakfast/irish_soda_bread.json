    "notes": "This is a rich, moist bread that is excellent fresh and toasts well the next day. Using salted butter only is perfectly fine, but don't use unsalted only, or the crust will suffer for it, taste-wise.",
    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour",
        "1/2 cup toasted wheat germ",
        "3 tbsp sugar",
        "1 1/2 tsp salt",
        "1 tsp baking powder",
        "1 tsp baking soda",
        "1/2 cup sunflower seeds",
        "1/4 cup flax seeds",
        "1 3/4 cups buttermilk, at room temperature",
        "2 tbsp unslated butter, melted",
        "1 tbsp salted butter, melted"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees F.",
        "Whisk all-purpose flours, wheat germ, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and seeds together in large bowl.",
        "Combine buttermilk and 2 tbsp melted unsalted butter in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.",
        "Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until cohesive mass forms, about 8 turns.",
        "Divide and pat dough into 1 rounds and transfer to a greased baking sheet. Using sharp serrated knife, make 1/4-inch deep cross about 5 inches long on top of loaf.",
        "Bake until skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.",
