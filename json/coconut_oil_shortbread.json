    "notes": "With unrefined coconut oil, this will have a strong coconut flavor. If that's not that you're looking for, use refined coconut oil and consider adding a teaspoon more of the extract of your choice (like almond).",
    "ingredients": [
        "1/2 cup coconut oil, room temperature (solid)",
        "1/4 cup sugar",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract",
        "1 cup flour"
    ],
    "steps": [
        "Cream oil, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and combined.",
        "Add flour and combine with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Do not overmix. The dough should be soft and workable, but not wet.",
        "Roll the dough about 1/3 inch thick, and cut out cookies with a cookie cutter. Arrange on a cookie sheet, and freeze for at least an hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 15-18 minutes.",
        "Cool completely on a wire rack before serving."
