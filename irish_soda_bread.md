Brown Irish Soda Bread
======================

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
- 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/4 cup flax seeds
- 1 3/4 cups buttermilk, at room temperature
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and divided

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and seeds together in large bowl. Combine buttermilk and 2 tbsp melted butter in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.

Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until cohesive mass forms, about 8 turns. Divide and pat dough into 1 rounds and transfer to prepared sheet. Using sharp serrated knife, make ¼-inch deep cross about 5 inches long on top of loaf. Bake until skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.

Remove bread from oven and brush with remaining 1 tbsp melted butter. Transfer loaf to wire rack to cool. Serve.
