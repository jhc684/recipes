Coconut Oil Pie Crust
=====================

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup refined solid coconut oil, chilled
- 8 tablespoons ice water

Combine flour and slat in a large bowl. Cut coconut oil in with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal, making sure there are no large pieces of coconut oil remaining.

Add ice water a couple of tablespoons at a time, mix by hand with a fork, just until dough begins to come together.

Turn dough out onto a cutting board or a smooth surface and form into a flattened disc. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour or overnight. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface when ready to use.
